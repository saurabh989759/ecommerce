## Features

- **User Management**: Secure login and authorization mechanisms.
- **Product Catalog**: Efficient sorting, filtering, and paging of products.
- **Payment Integration**: Support for Razorpay and Stripe payment gateways.
- **Service Discovery**: Microservices discovery and management.
- **Notification Service**: Real-time notifications for users.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced API response time using Redis for caching.
- **AWS Deployment**: Scalable deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with RDS for data persistence and CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.

## Architecture

The platform is built using a microservices architecture, ensuring modularity and scalability. Each service is independently deployable and focuses on specific functionalities.

### Microservices:

1. **Auth Service**: Handles user login, registration, and authorization.
2. **Product Service**: Manages the product catalog with features like sorting, filtering, and paging.
3. **Payment Service**: Integrates with Razorpay and Stripe for payment processing.
4. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users via various channels.
5. **Service Discovery**: Allows dynamic discovery of services for efficient communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11+
- Maven 3.6+
- AWS CLI configured
- Docker (optional for local deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-platform.git
   cd ecommerce-platform
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run services locally:**
   ```bash
   cd service-name
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   Repeat for each service you want to run.

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file or export environment variables directly.
   - Include details for database connections, API keys, etc.

### Configuration

- **Database Configuration:**
  - Update the `application.properties` file in each service with the correct database URL, username, and password.

- **Redis Configuration:**
  - Ensure Redis is installed and running locally or configure to connect to a remote instance.

- **Payment Gateway Configuration:**
  - Add your Razorpay and Stripe API keys to the respective services.

## Deployment

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment:**
   ```bash
   eb init
   eb create ecommerce-env
   ```

2. **Deploy the application:**
   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```

3. **Configure RDS and CloudWatch:**
   - Set up an RDS instance for MySQL.
   - Enable CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.

### Docker (Optional)

1. **Build Docker images:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t service-name .
   ```

2. **Run Docker containers:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 service-name
   ```

## Usage

1. **Access the Application:**
   - Once deployed, access the application via the AWS Elastic Beanstalk URL or your custom domain.

2. **APIs Documentation:**
   - Visit `/swagger-ui.html` for API documentation and testing.

3. **Admin Panel:**
   - Use the `/admin` endpoint for managing products, users, and services.
